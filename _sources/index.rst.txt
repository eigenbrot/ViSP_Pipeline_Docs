ViSP Pipeline Documentation
===========================

This package provides a pipeline that produces Level-1 Science Data for the ViSP instrument on DKIST.

Installation
------------
This package requires the presence of the ``PAC_Pipeline`` package, which will need to be installed manually.
The rest can be handled by pip:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org:dkistdc/visp-science-pipeline.git

Usage
-----
In its current
form the pipeline is a stand-alone program that relies on a user-editable configuration file. This file can be generated
with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ visp_pipeline -b config.ini

The file ``config.ini`` is editable with any standard editor. Once this file has been correctly populated the data can
be reduced with

.. code-block:: console

  $ visp_pipeline config.ini

More information on the format/options of the configuration file can be found in the :doc:`config_file`.
