Configuration File Format
=========================

The ViSP Pipeline configuration file is in the standard INI format and contains the following sections and options. Any
options in *italics* are optional.

.. note::
   It is OK to put science and calibration data all into the same directory. The specific task (Dark, Gain, Observation,
   etc.) is determined from the `DKIST004` header value.

Main
----
This section controls the top-level Science reduction. All of the \*_cal options point to files that will not exist
on the first run of the pipeline. Once these objects have been created a lot of time can be saved by reusing them for
any other science runs that have the same setup. It is also possible to regenerate only a subset of the intermediate
Calibration Objects by simply pointing the corresponding option to a file that doesn't exist.

:raw_sci_dir: Path to the directory containing raw ViSP frames to be reduced. Note that *all* slit positions found in
    this directory will be reduced. If you only want to reduce a subset of slit positions then move them into a separate
    folder or use the ``slit_pos`` option.

:data_set_id: Only reduce files with this `ID_004` header value. Can be left blank to reduce all files in ``raw_sci_dir``.

:output_prefix: The prefix to apply to all Level-1 science products. This string can also include a path structure.

:dark_cal: The location of a processed Dark Calibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:lamp_gain_cal: The location of a processed Lamp Gain Calibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:solar_gain_cal: The location of a processed Solar Gain Calibration object. If this files does not exist it will be generated.

:geometric_cal: The location of a processed Geometric Calibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:instrumen_pol_cal: The location of a processed Instrument Pol Calibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:telescope_pol_db: The location of the telescope mirror parameter database.

:gen_noise_frames: If True then uncertainty frames (suffixed "_err.fits") will be generated from the raw data and propagated through the pipeline. **NOTE** This more than doubles the total processing time.

:continuum_lims: The pixel range (in reduced images) that contains only continuum signal. The format is `NNN:MMM`. This information is used to compute QU/I cross-talk. This option is required if the data are polarimetric.

:threads: **(int)** The number of separate processes to spawn when reducing the raw science data.

:*include_parallactic*: If False, do NOT apply a correction to bring data in to common DKIST reference frame.

:save_M12_map: If True then save a full spatial map Stokes map of all slit positions for use by PA&C in determining M12 parameters

:*M12_lin_lims*: Pixel range containing features of high polarization signal (i.e., spectral lines). Format is `NNN:MMM`. If ``save_M12_map`` is True then this option is required.

:*slit_pos*: If present, this option is used to specify a subset of slit positions to reduce. This option can have one of three forms:

      :int: Just reduce a single slit position. Ex: `423`

      :list: Reduce the exact list of slit positions specified. Ex: `[423, 890, 132]`

      :NNN\:MMM: Reduce the slit positions specified by `range(NNN, MMM)`. Ex: `14:423`

:*remove_tele_pol*: If False, do NOT apply the inverse Telescope Model. Useful for synthetic data that were created without a TM.

DarkCalibration
---------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.dark_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_dark_dir: The location of a directory containing raw dark frames. If ``dark_cal`` does not exist then this
    directory must contain dark frames or an error will be thrown.

LampGainCalibration
-------------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.lamp_gain_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_lamp_gain: The location of a directory containing raw dark frames. If ``lamp_gain_cal`` does not exist then this
    directory must contain lamp gain frames or an error will be thrown.

SolarGainCalibration
--------------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.solar_gain_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_solar_gain: The location of a directory containing raw dark frames. If ``solar_gain_cal`` does not exist then this
    directory must contain solar gain frames or an error will be thrown.

InstrumentPolarimetricCalibration
---------------------------------
These options essentially define a separate ViSP reduction; the reduction of a polarimetric Calibration Sequence (CS).
The software will automatically decide the names for the output prefix and Calibration Objects. These will all be saved
to ``raw_pol_dir``/proc.

:raw_pol_dir: Path to a directory containing the raw ViSP files for a CS

:raw_dark_dir: Path to the raw dark files associated with the CS

:raw_lamp_gain_dir: Path to the raw lamp gain files associated with the CS

:raw_solar_gain_dir: Path to the raw solar gain files associated with the CS

:gen_noise_frames: If True then uncertainty frames (suffixed "_err.fits") will be generated from the raw data and propagated through the pipeline. **NOTE** This more than doubles the total processing time.

:telescope_db: Path to the file containing telescope mirror parameters as a function of time and wavelength

:cu_numbins_x: **(int)** The number of x-dimensions macropixels in the down-sampled CS data used for CU parameter fitting

:cu_numbins_y: **(int)** The number of y-dimensions macropixels in the down-sampled CS data used for CU parameter fitting

:demod_numbins_x: **(int)** The number of x-dimensions macropixels in the down-sampled CS data used for demodulation matrix calculation

:demod_numbins_y: **(int)** The number of y-dimensions macropixels in the down-sampled CS data used for demodulation matrix calculation

:threads: **(int)** The number of separate processes to use when reducing the CS data
